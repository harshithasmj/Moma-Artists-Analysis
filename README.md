# Moma-Artists-Analysis

Downloaded the publicly available Museum of Modern Art dataset on Artists and their biodata to run an analysis on the patterns ranging from nationality to age. 

The priority of this project was to understand which groups dominated the art industry based on the 15,000+ artists at MoMa. It included correlation coefficients, graphs, and other statistical anaylsis to draw inferences on the population.
